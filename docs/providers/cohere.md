[Cohere](https://cohere.com) provides OpenAI-compatible inference through its Compatibility API. OpenClaw provides Cohere as an official external plugin.

Reasoning-capable Cohere models support two Compatibility API reasoning modes. OpenClaw maps **off** to `none` and every enabled thinking level to `high`. Command A Vision does not support tool use, so OpenClaw keeps agent tools disabled for that model.

## Get started

1. Install the official plugin and restart the Gateway:

```bash
openclaw plugins install @openclaw/cohere-provider
openclaw gateway restart
```

2. Create a Cohere API key.
3. Run onboarding:

```bash
openclaw onboard --non-interactive \
  --auth-choice cohere-api-key \
  --cohere-api-key "$COHERE_API_KEY"
```

4. Confirm the catalog is available:

```bash
openclaw models list --provider cohere
```

Onboarding only sets Cohere as the primary model when no primary model is already configured.

## Environment-only setup

Make `COHERE_API_KEY` available to the Gateway process, then select the Cohere model:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: { primary: "cohere/command-a-plus-05-2026" },
    },
  },
}
```

<Note>
If the Gateway runs as a daemon or in Docker, set `COHERE_API_KEY` for that service. Exporting it only in an interactive shell does not make it available to an already-running Gateway.
</Note>
