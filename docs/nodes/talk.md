  - Implementing Talk mode on macOS/iOS/Android

title: "Talk mode"
---

Talk mode covers five runtime shapes:

- **Native macOS/iOS/Android Talk**: native speech recognition, Gateway chat, and `talk.speak` TTS. Apple Speech recognition on macOS/iOS may use network services; Android behavior depends on the installed speech service. Nodes advertise the `talk` capability and declare which `talk.*` commands they support.
- **iOS Talk (realtime)**: client-owned WebRTC for OpenAI realtime configs that select `webrtc` transport or omit transport, including framed and frameless transcript/audio events. Explicit `gateway-relay`, `provider-websocket`, and non-OpenAI realtime configs stay on the Gateway-owned relay; non-realtime configs use the native speech loop.
- **Browser Talk**: `talk.client.create` for client-owned `webrtc`/`provider-websocket` sessions, or `talk.session.create` for Gateway-owned `gateway-relay` sessions. `managed-room` is reserved for Gateway handoff and walkie-talkie rooms.
- **Android Talk (realtime)**: Android uses Gateway-owned relay realtime when `talk.catalog` reports the realtime group ready and the configured model passes the Android client gate; it never opens a client-owned WebRTC session. The Gateway now supports `gpt-live-*` relay sessions, but Android intentionally keeps those models on native speech recognition, Gateway chat, and `talk.speak` until the relay path is proven live from an Android device.
- **Transcription-only clients**: `talk.session.create({ mode: "transcription", transport: "gateway-relay", brain: "none" })`, then `talk.session.appendAudio`, `talk.session.cancelTurn`, and `talk.session.close` for captions/dictation without an assistant voice response. One-shot uploaded voice notes still use the [media understanding](/nodes/media-understanding) audio path.

Native Talk is a continuous loop: listen for speech, send the transcript to the model through the active session, wait for the response, then speak it via the configured Talk provider (`talk.speak`).

Client-owned realtime Talk normally forwards provider tool calls through `talk.client.toolCall` instead of calling `chat.send` directly. GPT-Live WebRTC sessions delegate on a Gateway-owned sideband, and the Gateway binds each delegation to the browser or Gateway-relay Talk session that owns it. Backend WebSocket bridges use the normal relay consult path. While a realtime consult is active, clients can call `talk.client.steer` or `talk.session.steer` to classify spoken input as `status`, `steer`, `cancel`, or `followup`; this includes GPT-Live delegations. Accepted steering queues into the active embedded run; rejected steering returns a reason such as `no_active_run`, `not_streaming`, or `compacting`. A newer GPT-Live spoken task also supersedes the running delegation.

Finalized realtime user and assistant utterances are always appended live to the active agent session, so later chat and voice turns share one history. Client-owned transports report their finalized transcripts with stable entry ids; Gateway relay sessions append the same events server-side. Provider sessions also receive the bounded realtime profile context used by Discord voice.

Voice-originated consult runs require a new, exact spoken confirmation before high-impact actions such as sending messages, controlling nodes, browser/computer actions, service changes, destructive shell commands, or publication. The gate applies to runs started through `talk.client.toolCall`, the Gateway relay, and GPT-Live sideband delegations. The confirmation applies only to the canonical final execution arguments and is consumed once; if a policy or hook rewrites the approved action, OpenClaw blocks it until the rewritten action is confirmed. Unrelated concurrent runs remain unaffected. When a call closes, OpenClaw can send a compact **Voice call changes** digest for mutating tools to the session's last non-WebChat delivery target.

Transcription-only Talk emits the same Talk event envelope as realtime and STT/TTS sessions, but uses `mode: "transcription"` and `brain: "none"`. All Talk sessions broadcast events on the `talk.event` channel; clients subscribe to it for partial/final transcript updates (`transcript.delta`/`transcript.done`) and other session telemetry.

Browser Video Talk is available for OpenAI Realtime WebRTC and Google Live
provider-WebSocket sessions. OpenAI gets a single bounded JPEG when
`describe_view` asks for visual context; it does not receive a continuous
camera track. Google Live receives bounded JPEG frames directly from the
browser at up to one frame per second, while `describe_view` reports the
camera-stream state. In both cases, camera frames bypass the Gateway, and
stopping Talk releases the camera and microphone tracks.

## Behavior (macOS)

- Always-on overlay while Talk mode is enabled.
- **Listening &rarr; Thinking &rarr; Speaking** phase transitions.
- On a short pause (silence window), the current transcript is sent.
- Replies are written to WebChat (same as typing).
- **Interrupt on speech** (default on): if the user talks while the assistant is speaking, playback stops and the interruption timestamp is noted for the next prompt.

## Voice directives in replies

The assistant can prefix a reply with a single JSON line to control voice:

```json
{ "voice": "<voice-id>", "once": true }
```

Rules:

- First non-empty line only; the JSON line is stripped before TTS playback.
- Unknown keys are ignored.
- `once: true` applies to the current reply only; without it, the voice becomes the new Talk mode default.

Supported keys: `voice` / `voice_id` / `voiceId`, `model` / `model_id` / `modelId`, `speed`, `rate` (WPM), `stability`, `similarity`, `style`, `speakerBoost`, `seed`, `normalize`, `lang`, `output_format`, `latency_tier`, `once`.

}
```

OpenAI browser WebRTC and Gateway-relay Talk support native GPT-Live through
`https://api.openai.com/v1/live`. Set `talk.realtime.model` to
`gpt-live-1-codex` (recommended) or `gpt-live-1-boulder-alpha`; `gpt-live-1`
and `gpt-live-1-mini` are not valid on this route. Browser and Gateway-relay
WebRTC prefer a ChatGPT OAuth subscription profile and fall back to Platform
API-key auth. Other backend bridges connect directly over the Frameless Bidi
WebSocket and require Platform API-key auth, whose `/v1/live` access is currently
[waitlist-gated](https://openai.com/form/gpt-live-1-in-the-api/).

The quickest setup is the Control UI: **Settings → Talk**, pick **OpenAI** and
a `gpt-live-*` model. The OAuth prerequisite is an OpenClaw auth profile
created with `openclaw models auth login --provider openai` — an existing
Codex CLI sign-in is not read. GPT-Live also requires the bundled `openai`
plugin registered in full mode; a restrictive `plugins.allow` list fails
session creation with "OpenAI GPT-Live browser session broker is unavailable".
Runtime bounds: 8 concurrent sessions per Gateway and a 30-minute session TTL.
Browser sessions also use 60-second single-use offer tokens.

GPT-Live accepts `alloy`, `ash`, `ballad`, `cedar`, `coral`, `echo`, `marin`,
`sage`, `shimmer`, and `verse`. A `403 Voice session access denied` response is
overloaded: an invalid voice returns the same response. The legacy
`chatgpt.com` backend route also returns `403`; OpenClaw uses the native
`api.openai.com/v1/live` route instead.

| Android realtime Talk       | Pending an Android device live-proof flip; Android stays on native Talk |

The Gateway-owned WebRTC route keeps OAuth and Platform credentials away from
relay clients. Backend WebSocket paths keep the Platform key on the Gateway;
OpenClaw converts telephony G.711 u-law audio to and from GPT-Live's 24 kHz PCM
contract.

For GA `gpt-realtime-2.1`, `gpt-realtime-2.1-mini`, and `gpt-realtime-2`
browser sessions, Platform credentials remain preferred in this order: the
configured realtime API key, an `openai` API-key profile, then
`OPENAI_API_KEY`. With none configured, browser Talk falls back to an OpenClaw
ChatGPT OAuth profile and exchanges SDP through the Gateway's single-use offer
broker, so the OAuth token never reaches the browser. A configured Platform
credential that cannot be resolved fails closed instead of silently falling
through to OAuth.

iOS client-owned WebRTC, Voice Call, GA Gateway relay, provider WebSocket
transports, Discord realtime voice, and Android realtime remain
Platform-key-only. GA browser Talk keeps the existing client-owned data channel
and `talk.client.toolCall` loop; only the credential owner and SDP exchange path
change under OAuth. GPT-Live Gateway relay prefers ChatGPT OAuth and falls back
to waitlist-enabled Platform access.

`talk.catalog` exposes canonical provider ids and registry aliases, each provider's valid modes/transports/brain strategies/realtime audio formats/capability flags, and the runtime-selected readiness result. First-party Talk clients should read that catalog instead of maintaining provider aliases locally; treat an older Gateway that omits group readiness as unverified rather than definitively unconfigured. Streaming transcription providers are discovered through `talk.catalog.transcription`; the current Gateway relay uses the Voice Call streaming provider config until a dedicated Talk transcription config surface ships.

## macOS UI

- Menu bar toggle: **Talk**
- Config tab: **Talk Mode** group (voice id + interrupt toggle)
- Overlay: the orb renders the universal talk waveform (shared with iOS, watchOS, and Android). Listening follows the live mic level, Speaking follows the actual TTS playback envelope, Thinking breathes softly. Click the orb to pause/resume, double-click to stop speaking, click X to exit Talk mode.

## Android UI

- Android's main navigation is **Home**, **Chat**, and **Settings**. Voice input
  lives in the Chat composer rather than a separate Voice tab.
- Tap the composer microphone for on-device dictation. Long-press it to record
  a voice-note attachment. Start continuous Talk from the Talk waveform.
- Dictation, voice-note recording, and Talk are mutually exclusive microphone
  paths; starting one stops or blocks the others.
- Realtime Talk prefers a connected Bluetooth Classic or BLE headset
  microphone; if it disconnects, the app requests another headset input or
  falls back to the default microphone, restoring the default preference once
  capture stops.
- Dictation and voice-note recording stop when the app leaves the foreground or
  the user leaves Chat.
- Talk Mode keeps running until toggled off or the node disconnects, using Android's microphone foreground-service type while active.
- Android supports `pcm_16000`, `pcm_22050`, `pcm_24000`, and `pcm_44100` output formats for low-latency `AudioTrack` streaming.

## Notes

- Requires Speech + Microphone permissions.
- Native Talk uses the active Gateway session and only falls back to history polling when response events are unavailable.
- The gateway resolves Talk playback through `talk.speak` using the active Talk provider. Android falls back to local system TTS only when that RPC is unavailable.
- macOS local MLX playback uses the bundled `openclaw-mlx-tts` helper when present, or an executable on `PATH`. Set `OPENCLAW_MLX_TTS_BIN` to point at a custom helper binary during development. The helper streams PCM, keeps one selected model resident, and supports Fish S2 Pro reference audio through `providers.mlx.referenceAudioPath` plus `referenceText`.
- Voice directive value ranges (ElevenLabs): `stability`, `similarity`, and `style` accept `0..1`; `speed` accepts `0.5..2`; `latency_tier` accepts `0..4`.
