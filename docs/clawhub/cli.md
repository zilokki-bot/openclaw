# ClawHub CLI

Two command-line surfaces talk to ClawHub:

- `openclaw skills` / `openclaw plugins` - discover, install, and update
  packages for a local OpenClaw agent or Gateway.
- The standalone `clawhub` CLI - remove installed skills and handle publisher
  workflows including login, publish, sync, and transfer.

## Discover and install

```bash
openclaw skills search "calendar"
openclaw skills install @owner/<slug>
openclaw skills install @owner/<slug> --version <version> --global
openclaw skills install skills-sh:<owner>/<repo>/<slug>
openclaw skills update @owner/<slug>
openclaw skills update --all --acknowledge-clawhub-risk
openclaw skills verify @owner/<slug> --card

openclaw plugins search "calendar"
openclaw plugins install clawhub:<package>
openclaw plugins install clawhub:<package> --acknowledge-clawhub-risk
openclaw plugins update <id-or-npm-spec>
openclaw plugins update --all
```

Skill installs target the active workspace `skills/` directory by default; add
`--global` for the shared managed skills directory. Plugin installs need the
explicit `clawhub:` prefix to force ClawHub resolution over npm, git, or a
local path. Full flag reference: [`openclaw skills`](/cli/skills) and
[`openclaw plugins`](/cli/plugins).

`skills-sh:` is an explicitly external catalog reference. OpenClaw sends it to
ClawHub and installs the exact commit-pinned GitHub source returned by the
resolver; it never downloads skill content from skills.sh directly. Unclaimed
entries are labeled **Not scanned by ClawHub**. Claimed and ClawHub-scanned
skills use the native `@owner/<slug>` form instead.

### Release trust

OpenClaw checks a release's ClawHub trust state before downloading it, for
both skills and plugins. Versioned releases use exact-release trust metadata;
resolver-backed GitHub skills go through ClawHub's install resolver, which
enforces scan and force-install policy before returning a pinned commit.

- **Malicious or blocked** releases are refused outright.
- **Risky** releases (non-clean scan, non-blocking moderation state) print a
  warning and require `--acknowledge-clawhub-risk` to continue
  non-interactively.
- **Official ClawHub publishers/packages and bundled OpenClaw sources** skip
  the trust prompt and security-verdict fetch entirely.

## Remove an installed skill

If the standalone ClawHub CLI is not already installed, install it explicitly:

```bash
npm i -g clawhub
clawhub uninstall @owner/my-skill
```

The command asks for confirmation, then removes the installed skill directory
and its ClawHub lockfile entry. Select the original agent workspace or shared
OpenClaw state directory when the installation is outside the current workdir:

```bash
clawhub --workdir /path/to/agent-workspace uninstall @owner/my-skill
clawhub --workdir ~/.openclaw uninstall @owner/my-skill
```

For a custom `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, replace `~/.openclaw` with that configured
directory. See [Remove a ClawHub skill](/cli/skills#remove-a-clawhub-skill) for
workspace targeting and skill refresh behavior.

## Publish and maintain

Install the standalone CLI once, then log in:

```bash
npm i -g clawhub
clawhub login
```

Publish a plugin package (folder path, GitHub repo `owner/repo[@ref]`, or
tarball URL) with `clawhub package publish`:

```bash
clawhub package publish ./my-plugin --dry-run
clawhub package publish ./my-plugin
clawhub package publish your-org/your-plugin@v1.0.0
```

Publish a skill folder with `clawhub skill publish`:

```bash
clawhub skill publish ./skills/review-helper
clawhub skill publish ./skills/review-helper --version 1.0.0 --owner your-org
```

Other maintenance commands:

```bash
clawhub sync --all                                          # scan local skills, publish new/updated ones
clawhub package transfer @old-owner/package --to new-owner   # move a plugin package to another publisher
clawhub skill rename old-slug new-slug                       # rename a published skill, redirect the old slug
clawhub explore --sort trending                              # browse the registry, sorted by trending
```
