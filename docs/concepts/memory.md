OpenClaw remembers things by writing plain Markdown files in your agent's
workspace (default `~/.openclaw/workspace`). The model only remembers what gets
saved to disk; there is no hidden state.

## How it works

Your agent has four memory-related files:

- **`USER.md`** (optional) — stable preferences, communication style,
  relationships, and active-project context written as directives. Loaded at
  the start of a session with a separate small budget.
- **`MEMORY.md`** — long-term memory. Durable non-profile facts and decisions.
  Loaded at the start of a session.
- **`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`** (or `memory/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`) — daily notes.
  Running context and observations. Today's and yesterday's dated notes load
  automatically on a bare `/new` or `/reset`; slugged variants, such as those
  written by the bundled session-memory hook, are picked up alongside the
  date-only file.
- **`DREAMS.md`** (optional) — Dream Diary and dreaming sweep summaries for
  human review, including grounded historical backfill entries.

<Tip>
If you want your agent to remember something, just ask it: "Remember that I
prefer TypeScript." It writes the note to the appropriate file.
</Tip>

## What goes where

`USER.md` is the compact user-model layer. Write stable preferences and profile
facts as imperative directives with observed-date and active/superseded
metadata. When a preference changes, supersede it in place instead of appending
a contradictory active directive. See [User model](/concepts/user-model).

`MEMORY.md` is the compact, curated layer for durable non-profile facts,
standing decisions, and short summaries that should be available at the start
of a session. It is not a raw transcript, daily log, or exhaustive archive.

`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files are the working layer: detailed daily notes,
observations, session summaries, and raw context that may still be useful
later. These are indexed for `memory_search` and `memory_get`, but are not
injected into the bootstrap prompt on every turn.

Over time, useful material from daily notes is distilled into `MEMORY.md` by
the default [dreaming](/concepts/dreaming) sweep. The generated workspace
instructions still encourage the agent to record durable facts as it works,
while dreaming handles background consolidation. The default heartbeat prompt
performs no memory maintenance on its own.

If `MEMORY.md` grows past the bootstrap file budget, OpenClaw keeps the file on
disk intact but truncates the copy injected into context. Treat that as a
signal to move detailed material into `memory/*.md`, keep only a durable
summary in `MEMORY.md`, or raise the bootstrap limits if you want to spend more
prompt budget. Use `/context list`, `/context detail`, or `openclaw doctor` to
see raw vs. injected sizes and truncation status.

## Import from coding assistants

The Control UI can import existing local memory from Codex, Claude Code, and
Hermes.
Open **Settings** → **Import Memory**, choose the destination agent, review the
detected files, and confirm the import. For the existing default agent, you can
instead open **Settings → Ask OpenClaw** and say `import memory`; this narrower
chat wizard requires completed onboarding, copies only new detected memory, and
reports per-source failures or possible partial copies. OpenClaw copies only
Markdown memory:

- Codex: the consolidated `MEMORY.md` and `memory_summary.md` files under
  `~/.codex/memories` (or `CODEX_HOME/memories`). Raw rollout and transcript
  files are not imported.
- Claude Code: Markdown files from each project auto-memory directory under
  `~/.claude/projects/*/memory`, plus a user-configured
  `autoMemoryDirectory` when present. Project instructions, sessions, settings,
  and credentials are not part of this memory-only action.
- Hermes: `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` from the detected Hermes home. Config,
  credentials, and skills are not part of this memory-only action.

Imported files stay separate under `memory/imports/codex/` and
`memory/imports/claude-code/`, or `memory/imports/hermes/` in the selected agent
workspace. They are indexed for `memory_search` and available through
`memory_get`; they are not merged into the agent's bootstrap `MEMORY.md`. The
source files are left unchanged.

The preview marks destination conflicts. Enable **Replace existing imports** to
replace those files; apply creates a verified pre-import backup and preserves
item-level copies of overwritten files in the migration report.

## Action-sensitive memories

Most memories are ordinary Markdown notes. Some affect what the agent should
do later; for those, capture when it is safe to act on the note, not just the
fact itself.

Capture that action boundary when a note involves:

- approval or permission requirements,
- temporary constraints,
- handoffs to another session, thread, or person,
- expiry conditions,
- safe-to-act timing,
- source or owner authority,
- instructions to avoid a tempting action.

A useful action-sensitive memory makes clear:

- what changes future behavior,
- when or under what condition it applies,
- when it expires, or what unlocks action,
- what the agent should avoid doing,
- who is the source or owner, if that affects trust or authority.

Memory can preserve approval context, but it does not enforce policy. Use
OpenClaw approval settings, sandboxing, and scheduled tasks for hard
operational controls.

Example:

```md
The API migration is being designed in another session. Future turns should
not edit the API implementation from this thread; use findings here only as
design input until the migration plan lands.
```

Another example:

```md
A report from an untrusted source needs review before promotion. Future turns
should treat it as evidence only; do not store it as durable memory until a
trusted reviewer confirms the contents.
```

This is not a required schema for every memory; simple facts can stay concise.
Use action-sensitive boundaries when losing timing, authority, expiry, or
safe-to-act context could cause the agent to do the wrong thing later.

Use [scheduled tasks](/automation/cron-jobs) for exact reminders, timed checks,
and recurring work. Memory can still summarize the durable context around that
work.

## Retired inferred commitments

Some future follow-ups are not durable facts. If a future event should trigger
an action, use a [standing intent](/concepts/standing-intents). If a clock time
should trigger it, use a [scheduled task](/automation/cron-jobs).

The inferred commitments experiment is retired. OpenClaw no longer extracts or
delivers those follow-ups. Use [scheduled tasks](/automation/cron-jobs) for
future actions; the legacy `openclaw commitments` command remains available to
inspect or dismiss existing stored rows.

## Memory tools

The agent has three tools for working with memory:

- **`memory_search`** — finds relevant notes using semantic search, even when
  the wording differs from the original.
- **`memory_get`** — reads a specific memory file or line range.
- **`intent`** — creates, lists, or explicitly cancels event-conditioned
  standing intents. Time-based reminders continue to use scheduled tasks.

Both tools are provided by the active memory plugin (default: `memory-core`).

## Memory search

When an embedding provider is configured, `memory_search` uses hybrid search:
vector similarity (semantic meaning) combined with keyword matching (exact
terms like IDs and code symbols). This works out of the box with an API key
for any supported provider.

<Info>
OpenClaw uses OpenAI embeddings by default. Set
`memory.search.provider` explicitly to use Gemini, Voyage,
Mistral, Bedrock, DeepInfra, local GGUF, Ollama, LM Studio, GitHub Copilot, or
a generic OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
</Info>

See [Memory search](/concepts/memory-search) for how search works, tuning
options, and provider setup.

## Knowledge wiki layer

If you want durable memory to behave more like a maintained knowledge base
than raw notes, use the bundled `memory-wiki` plugin. It compiles durable
knowledge into a wiki vault with deterministic page structure, structured
claims and evidence, contradiction and freshness tracking, generated
dashboards, compiled digests, and wiki-native tools (`wiki_status`,
`wiki_search`, `wiki_get`, `wiki_apply`, `wiki_lint`).

`memory-wiki` does not replace the active memory plugin; the active memory
plugin still owns recall, promotion, and dreaming. `memory-wiki` adds a
provenance-rich knowledge layer beside it. You can browse the compiled wiki
in the Control UI under Memory → Dreams → Diary → **Memory Wiki**
([details](/plugins/memory-wiki#browsing-the-wiki-in-the-control-ui)).

## Automatic memory flush

Before [compaction](/concepts/compaction) summarizes your conversation,
OpenClaw runs a silent turn that reminds the agent to save important context
to memory files. This is on by default; set
`agents.defaults.compaction.memoryFlush.enabled: false` to turn it off.

To keep that housekeeping turn on a local model, set an exact override that
applies only to the memory-flush turn (it does not inherit the active
session's model fallback chain):

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "compaction": {
        "memoryFlush": {
          "model": "ollama/qwen3:8b"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Tip>
The memory flush prevents context loss during compaction. If your agent has
important facts in the conversation that are not yet written to a file, they
are saved automatically before the summary happens.
</Tip>

## Dreaming

Dreaming is the default background consolidation path for memory. It collects
short-term recall signals, scores candidates, and promotes only qualified
owner or agent-derived items into long-term memory (`MEMORY.md`):

- **Default on**: disable it with
  `plugins.entries.memory-core.config.dreaming.enabled: false`.
- **Scheduled**: when enabled, `memory-core` auto-manages one recurring cron
  job for a full dreaming sweep.
- **Thresholded**: promotions must pass score, recall-frequency, and
  query-diversity gates.
- **Consolidated**: a bounded subagent rewrite merges duplicates and
  supersedes stale entries after the deterministic gate. Invalid or
  unavailable rewrites use append-only fallback.
- **Taint gated**: untrusted and system-derived candidates never enter the
  consolidation prompt or durable promotion path.
- **Reviewable**: phase summaries and diary entries are written to
  `DREAMS.md` for human review, including rewrite counts and highlights.

This background pattern follows the motivation behind sleep-time compute
(arXiv:2504.13171). Provenance-aware reflection also follows the durable
memory lessons of the Generative Agents research.

See [Dreaming](/concepts/dreaming) for phase behavior, scoring signals, and
Dream Diary details.

## Grounded backfill and live promotion

The dreaming system has two related review lanes:

- **Live dreaming** works from the short-term dreaming store under
  `memory/.dreams/` and is what the normal deep phase uses to decide what
  graduates into `MEMORY.md`.
- **Grounded backfill** reads historical `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` notes as
  standalone day files and writes structured review output into `DREAMS.md`.

Grounded backfill is useful for replaying older notes and inspecting what the
system considers durable, without manually editing `MEMORY.md`.

```bash
openclaw memory rem-backfill --path ./memory --stage-short-term
```

The `--stage-short-term` flag stages grounded durable candidates into the same
short-term dreaming store the normal deep phase already uses; it does not
promote them directly. So:

- `DREAMS.md` stays the human review surface.
- The short-term store stays the machine-facing ranking surface.
- `MEMORY.md` is still only written by deep promotion.

To undo a replay without touching ordinary diary entries or normal recall
state:

```bash
openclaw memory rem-backfill --rollback
openclaw memory rem-backfill --rollback-short-term
```

## CLI

```bash
openclaw memory status          # Check index status and provider
openclaw memory search "query"  # Search from the command line
openclaw memory index --force   # Rebuild the index
```
